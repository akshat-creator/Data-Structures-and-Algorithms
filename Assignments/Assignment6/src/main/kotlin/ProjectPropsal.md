# Project Proposal: Investigating All Pairs Shortest Path Algorithm

### 1.    Project Overview:
   For this project, I will delve into the study and implementation of the All Pairs Shortest Path (APSP) algorithm. The APSP algorithm is a fundamental problem in graph theory and has widespread applications in various fields such as network routing, transportation systems, and social network analysis. Through this project, I aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the APSP algorithm, implement it using Kotlin, and analyze its performance characteristics.

### 2. Project Deliverables:
   - Implementation of the APSP Algorithm: I will implement the APSP algorithm from scratch using Kotlin programming language. The implementation will include relevant data structures and algorithms necessary for the efficient computation of shortest paths in graphs.
   - Code Repository: I will maintain a Git repository containing the Kotlin code for the APSP algorithm implementation. The repository will be regularly updated with commits documenting the progress and changes made during the implementation.
   - Summary of Algorithm: Alongside the implementation, I will provide a detailed summary explaining how the APSP algorithm works, its underlying principles, and the computational complexities involved.
   - Report on Applications: I will research and compile a report highlighting former and current applications of the APSP algorithm across various domains. This report will provide insights into the real-world significance and relevance of the algorithm.
   - Performance Analysis: I will conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of the implemented APSP algorithm. This will involve benchmarking the algorithm's execution time on graphs of varying sizes and densities. I will document the results and analyze the changes in performance resulting from optimizations applied to the code.
   - Project Summary:I will provide a brief summary summarizing the work done, key findings, and any insights gained from the project.
