# Markov Text Analysis with Associative Arrays

In Markov text analysis, the goal is to create a model that analyzes a text corpus and predicts the likelihood of each word following another word in the text. This is achieved by building a frequency map of word transitions.

## Approach

The `MarkovTextAnalysis` class reads a text file and tokenizes it into words. It then removes punctuation and filters out blank words. Using an `AssociativeArray`, the class builds a word frequency map where each word is associated with the number of times it follows the target word specified. Finally, the frequency map is printed.

## Results

Applying associative arrays simplifies the implementation of the Markov text analysis algorithm. By using the associative array, we efficiently track word frequencies without needing to predefine a fixed-size array or complex data structures. This allows for a straightforward and concise implementation of the Markov model. However, it's important to note that this implementation considers only immediate word transitions and doesn't account for higher-order Markov models. For more advanced text generation, extending the analysis to higher orders or incorporating probabilities could yield more sophisticated results.

Overall, associative arrays prove to be a versatile tool for handling frequency-based data structures, providing a convenient solution for tasks like text analysis and generation.
