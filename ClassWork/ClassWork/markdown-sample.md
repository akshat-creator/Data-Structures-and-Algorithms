Learning Goals for DSA
====

My learning goals for the semester were: 

  * To get better at technical interviews - I feel with assignments having multiple leet code problems, I have somewhat been able to achieve this goal. I would defiantly like to practice more technical questions to prep myself better for future interviews. I might try to work on more technical questions over the summer. 
  * I also want to make a good project to add to my resume, I feel my resume currently lacks software projects and making a good final project would help me add it to my resume.
